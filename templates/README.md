# Code Templates

This directory stores reusable templates for code generation tools such as
Cobigen or OpenAPI Generator. By keeping these templates in the repository,
changes can be versioned and shared across modules. In a real project, this
folder could be split into a dedicated Git submodule to allow independent
versioning.
